# GitHub Action

{% hint style="info" %}
Our GitHub Action supports vanilla webpack projects and Create React App out of the box.  For other platforms, see platform specific documentation if available, along with how to use our webpack plugin directly.
{% endhint %}

### Add your workflow

By far the simplest way to send us your build stats is to utilize [our GitHub Action](https://github.com/packtracker/report).

You _can_ set this up in GitHub Actions UI, or you can use the following workflow to get started quickly in your `.github/workflows/push.yml`

```text
on: push
name: packtracker.io
jobs:
  report:
    name: report webpack stats
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: report webpack stats
      uses: packtracker/report@2.2.7
      env:
        PT_PROJECT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
        WEBPACK_CONFIG_PATH: ./config/webpack/production.js

```

### Add your project token

You will also need to add your project token as a secret.
